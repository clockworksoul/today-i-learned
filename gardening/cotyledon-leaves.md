# Why Are the Cotyledon Leaves on a Tomato Plant Falling Off?

Starting seeds indoors for a summer garden is an act of faith -- in biology and your own ability to manipulate the indoor environment successfully. Once the raggedy little "true" leaves begin to unfold, the moon-shaped baby leaves, called cotyledons, may drop off. Fear not -- these leaves have finished their job and are making way for adult growth on the plant's stalk.

## Cotyledon Facts

Seeds are embryonic plants, complete with roots, stem and branches (or rather, radicles, hypocotyls and plumules). They also hold two fleshy seed leaves called cotyledons that will inflate with water as the seed germinates and pull the stem upward as the seedling's root grows deeper. Once above ground, the cotyledons unfold so the plumule can begin to grow into branches and leaves to support the plant's mature growth, flowers and fruits. The cotyledons' job is finished once the adult, or "true," leaves unfold and begin their task of photosynthesis.

## Early Growth

The section of the stalk above ground but below the cotyledon becomes very thick and bumpy as the plant's branches and leaves unfold. If the ground is dry or the roots are cramped, these bumps may grow into aerial roots to gather moisture. Roots may also grow under the cotyledons, pushing the fleshy little seed leaves away, much as baby teeth are displaced by adult teeth. If top growth is leggy, gardeners plant seedlings as deep as the cotyledons -- or as far up the stem as the first set of true leaves -- to allow the plant to start more roots to draw nitrogen from the soil.

## Failing Cotyledons

Because it is a storage organ, the cotyledon is an inefficient provider for the adult plant, so it will shrivel and fall away from the plant as shade from the growing plant covers it, either because of senescence or because it is being edged out by an emerging root. When cotyledons fall away after several branches of true leaves have formed, it means that the plant has passed from the seedling stage to the mature stage of its growth and adult leaves have taken over. If, however, the plant gets too much water and falls victim to a fungal disease known as "damping off," the cotyledons may fold before the adult leaves have a chance to deploy.

## Garden Planting

Loss of seed leaves typically occurs when plants have acclimated to their surroundings in the garden. If you've started plants four to six weeks before the last frost date and taken them out a day at a time before finally planting them when the soil temperature reaches 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the cotyledons should fall off within a week or two. If, however, you jump the start and plant tomatoes when soil temperature is in the 50s, the plants may go temporarily dormant and start actively growing until only after the soil warms up. In that case, the cotyledons might hang on for several weeks until they become obsolescent and fade.
