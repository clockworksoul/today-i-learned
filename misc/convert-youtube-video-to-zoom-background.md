# Converting a YouTube video to a Zoom background

Fun fact: Zoom doesn't seem to have a maximum video size, so go ahead and add whatever videos you like.

Important: busy backgrounds can be distracting to others. Please be respectful and keep your video background choices subtle.

## Choose Your Video

For copyright reasons, you may have difficulty downloading videos with music in them.

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0tU18Ybcvk

If you have any specific start or stop times, note them.

## Find a YouTube (mp4) download site

There are a [wealth of YouTube download sites on the Internet](https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+downloader) that let you to transcode YouTube videos into other formats. Choose any one you like, but be sure that it supports mp4 format.

I like https://www.clipconverter.cc/ because it supports start and stop timestamps.

## Do the thing

Use your transcoder site of choice to convert your video, and download the resulting mp4, ideally to a dedicated directory for Zoom wallpapers.

Be sure to choose a meaningful name so you can find it later!
