A Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. 

In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called _seeds_).

For each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called _Voronoi cells_.
