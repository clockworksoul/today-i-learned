* Prep Time: 15 minutes
* Yield: 2 pie crusts

This recipe provides enough for a double crust pie. If you only need one crust, you can cut the recipe in half, or freeze the other half.

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cups (315g) **all-purpose flour** (spoon & leveled)
* 1 teaspoon **salt**
* 6 tablespoons (90g) **unsalted butter**, chilled and cubed
* 3/4 cup (148g) **vegetable shortening**, chilled
* 1/2 cup of **ice water**

## Instructions

1. Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter and shortening.

2. Using a pastry cutter ([the one I own](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D471TC8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title)) or two forks, cut the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is OK). A pastry cutter makes this step very easy and quick.

3. Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around. From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water– since the ice has melted a bit. Drizzle the cold water in, 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time, and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon (15ml) added. Do not add any more water than you need to. Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps. I always use about 1/2 cup (120ml) of water and a little more in dry winter months (up to 3/4 cup).

4. Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky. Using floured hands, fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into the fats. Form it into a ball. Divide dough in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands.

5. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (and up to 5 days).

6. When rolling out the chilled pie dough discs to use in your pie, always use gentle force with your rolling pin. Start from the center of the disc and work your way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands as you go. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal and expected!

7. Proceed with the pie per your recipe’s instructions.

## Notes

1. **Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions:** Prepare the pie dough through step 4 and freeze the discs for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using in your pie recipe.

2. **Salt:** I use and strongly recommend regular table salt. If using kosher salt, use 1 and 1/2 teaspoons.
