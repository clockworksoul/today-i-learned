## How to make easy cookies from scratch

Like I said, these cookies are crazy easy, however here are a few notes.

1. **Soften butter.** If you are planning on making these, take the butter out of the fridge first thing in the morning so it’s ready to go when you need it.

2. **Measure the flour correctly.** Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). There has been some controversy on how to measure flour. I personally use the scoop and shake method and always have (gasp)! It’s easier and I have never had that method fail me.  Many of you say that the only way to measure flour is to scoop it into the measuring cup and level with a knife. I say, measure it the way _**you**_ always do. Just make sure that the dough matches the consistency of the dough in the photos in this post.

3. **Use LOTS of chocolate chips.** Do I really need to explain this?!

4. **DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies!** I explain this more below, but these chocolate chip cookies will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.

## How do you make gooey chocolate chip cookies?

The trick to making this best chocolate chip cookie recipe gooey is to not over-bake them. At the end of the baking time, these chocolate chip cookies **won’t look done** but they are.

### Notes

* Butter. If you use unsalted butter, increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp total.
* Some people have said they think the cookies are too salty. Please be sure to use natural Sea Salt (not iodized table salt). If you are concerned about saltiness start with 1/2 tsp salt and adjust to your tastes.

2. In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder. Set aside.

8. Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just BARELY starting to turn brown.
9. Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.
