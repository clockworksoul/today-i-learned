# Apple Pie

_Source: Modified from [A Taste of Home: Apple Pie](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/apple-pie/)_

The original recipe produces a pie that's delicious, but runny and somewhat underdone. Replacing flour with ground tapioca sufficiently thickens the filling, increasing the baking time and temperature ensures an adequate bake.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup **sugar**
* 1/2 cup packed **brown sugar**
* 3 tablespoons **ground tapioca**
* 1 teaspoon **cinnamon**
* 1/4 teaspoon **ginger**
* 1/4 teaspoon **nutmeg**
* 6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled **tart apples** (Granny Smith, maybe some sweet, crisp apples like Golden Delicious thrown in, work great)
* 1 tablespoon **lemon juice**
* **Dough for double-crust pie** ([this recipe](perfect-pie-crust.md) works great)
* 1 tablespoon **butter**
* 1 large **egg**
* Additional **sugar**

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).

2. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices; set aside.

3. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat.

4. On a lightly floured surface, roll one half of dough to a 12-inch circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Trim even with rim.

5. Add filling; dot with butter.

6. Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top.

7. Beat egg until foamy; brush over crust. Sprinkle with sugar. Cover edge loosely with foil.

8. Bake at 425°F (218°C) for 20-25 minutes.

9. Reduce temperature to 350°F (176°C); Remove foil; bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30-50 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack.
