_Source: modified from https://breaddad.com/bread-machine-banana-bread/_

## Ingredients

* 1/2 Cup – Milk (warm)
* 2 – Eggs (beaten)
* 8 Tablespoons – Butter (softened)
* 1 Teaspoon – Vanilla Extract
* 3 – Bananas (Ripe), Medium Sized (mashed)
* 1 Cup – White Granulated Sugar
* 2 Cups – Flour (all-purpose)
* 1/2 Teaspoon – Salt
* 2 Teaspoons – Baking Powder (aluminum free)
* 1 Teaspoon – Baking Soda
* 1/2 Cup - Chopped Walnuts

## Instructions

* Prep Time – 10 minutes
* Baking Time – 1:40 hours
* Bread Machine Setting – Quick Bread
* Beat the eggs.
* Mash bananas with a fork.
* Soften the butter in microwave.
* Pour the milk into the bread pan and then add the other ingredients (except the walnuts). Try to follow the order of the ingredients listed above so that liquid ingredients are placed in the bread pan first and the dry ingredients second. Be aware that the bread pan should be removed from the bread machine before you start to add any ingredients. This helps to avoid spilling any material inside the bread machine.
* Put the bread pan (with all of the ingredients) back into the bread machine and close the bread machine lid.
* Start the machine after checking the settings (i.e. make sure it is on the quick bread setting).
* Add chopped walnuts when the machine stops after the first kneading.
When the bread machine has finished baking the bread, remove the bread pan and place it on a wooden cutting board. Let the bread stay within the bread pan (bread loaf container) for 10 minutes before you remove it from the bread pan. Use oven mitts when removing the bread pan because it will be very hot!
After removing the bread from the bread pan, place the bread on a cooling rack. Use oven mitts when removing the bread.
Don’t forget to remove the mixing paddle if it is stuck in the bread. Use oven mitts as the mixing paddle could be hot.
You should allow the banana bread to completely cool before cutting. This can take up to 2 hours. Otherwise, the banana bread will break (crumble) more easily when cut.
