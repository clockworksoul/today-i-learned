# Never Attribute to Stupidity That Which Is Adequately Explained by Opportunity Cost

[Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) is a classic aphorism I'm sure you have heard before: _Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity_.

I've found that neither malice nor stupidity is the most common reason when you don't understand why something is in a certain way. Instead, the root cause is probably just that _they didn't have time yet_. This happens all the time at startups (maybe a bit less at big companies, for reasons I'll get back to).

Some examples of things I hear all the time:

* I don't understand why team X isn't working on _feature idea_ Y. It's such an obvious thing to do!

* Why is _bug_ Z still present? Hasn't it been known for a really long time? I don't understand why they aren't fixing it?

* I don't get why HR team still doesn't offer _perk_ W. So many other companies have that!

* I've told my manager that we need a process for _thing_ V but it still hasn't happened!

Of course, why these things never happened is that something else was more important. Quoting Wikipedia on [Opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost):

>When an option is chosen from alternatives, the opportunity cost is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit associated with the best alternative choice. The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen." In simple terms, opportunity cost is the benefit not received as a result of not selecting the next best option.

Thus I've started telling people: _Never attribute to stupidity that which is adequately explained by opportunity cost_.
